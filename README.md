# Kernel Protocol

`kernel-protocol` contains the specification and the documentation of the Jupyter Kernel Protocol
and related (kernelspec, connection info).

Changes to the protocol should not be handled here, but submitted as Jupyter Enhancement Proposals
in the [dedicated repository](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals).
